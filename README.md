# AdBrand Dashboard

A modern, clean, and extensible dashboard built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and TypeScript. This project features optimized, human-friendly code, improved navigation, and a focus on maintainability and usability.

## Features

- **Next.js + TypeScript**: Fast, scalable, and type-safe.
- **Dashboard Structure**: Organized under `/dashboard` with Overview, Reporting, and Settings pages.
- **Navigation**: Sidebar and mobile drawer with active route highlighting.
- **Overview Page**: Metrics, charts, filters, and a data tableâ€”cleaned up for readability and maintainability.
- **Reusable Skeleton Loader**: For loading states in cards, charts, and tables (`src/components/ui/Skeleton.tsx`).
- **Animated Placeholders**: "Coming Soon" for Reporting and Settings pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, consistent styling.
- **Lucide Icons**: Modern icon set for navigation and UI elements.
